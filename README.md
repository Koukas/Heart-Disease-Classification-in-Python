The aim of this project is to investigate the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting
the occurrence of heart disease. The study aims to utilize a dataset containing eleven features along
with a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Through comprehensive
analysis and implementation of six machine learning models, the research seeks to assess the efficacy of
predictive models in detecting heart disease instances.
